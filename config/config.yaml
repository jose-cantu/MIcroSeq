# config/config.yaml tells my code where things live and how to behave at runtime (think log level, executable paths, pipeline parameters) - load_config() helper points to this file 

logging:
  level: DEBUG 
tools:
  trimmomatic: trimmomatic # already on path so commands names here are just fine taking into account command calls 
  blastn: blastn 
  cap3: cap3
